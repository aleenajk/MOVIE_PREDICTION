# Malayalam Movie Guessing Game  

## Project Overview  
This is a fun command-line game built with **Python** and **Pandas**, where players try to guess the name of a Malayalam movie based on clues like:  
- Director  
- Main Cast  
- Movie Plot  

The game selects a random movie from a dataset (`malayalam_movies.csv`) and gives you clues one by one. Your score depends on how quickly you guess the movie!

## Features  
- Random movie selection from dataset  
- Multiple clues per movie (Director, Cast, Summary)  
- Scoring system (higher points for fewer attempts)  
- Keeps track of total score across rounds  
- Option to play multiple rounds

# Scoring System  

- You start each round with **maximum points** (equal to the number of clues).  
- Each wrong attempt deducts **1 point**.  
- If you fail to guess after all clues, you score **0** for that round.  
- Your total score accumulates across rounds.

- Add difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)  
- Create a leaderboard system  
- Build a simple GUI version
